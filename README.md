Make sure to compile the TypeScript with
```tsc @tsc-compile.txt -t esnext``` (Add `-w` if you want to watch for files to be edited if you are editing the TypeScript. Do not edit the JS files created.).
You may get an error. This is normal, and it should've created .js files paired with the .ts files. If not, please join the OPSS Discord server at https://bit.ly/join-pluto-support.
