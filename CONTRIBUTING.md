# Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is an event pushing for open-source awareness and promoting contributions from everyone!\
This repository is actively taking part in this event, so don't feel afraid to contribute!

Feel free to explore the existing structure and infrastructure already set up on the bot.\
New ideas are also welcome, for commands, functionality, or even very small or very large changes!\
I am also actively looking for more documentation, since I barely understand my own bot. I currently have no documentation after the latest rewrite!\

Thanks so much, and get hacking!
